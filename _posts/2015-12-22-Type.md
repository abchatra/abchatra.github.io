###Introduction
Javascript is an untyped language. Type in the context of this blog refers to a datastructure in the runtime which holds type information about an object. Type is also known as hidden class. Sole purpose of type in the runtime is to enhance performance of the user script code. If you are building your own javascript runtime and didn't care about performance or the memory you don't need type. Let us dig a bit deeper to see why we need Type.

###Type shares information
Take a simple example below.

```js
funcion Point(x, y)
{ 
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}
var one = new Point(10,20);
var two = new Point(40,50);

print(one.x);
print(two.x);
```

Above example creates two *Points* each has properties x and y. Chakra needs to store following information in the runtime:

1.  Objects one and two have properites x and y
2.  Object one has property x whose value is 10 and property y whose value is 20
3.  Object two has property x whose value is 40 and property y whose value is 50

Above information is retrieved when script wants to print the property or set the property. As you can see in the above information (1) is common across all the objects created from constructor *Point*. This information is sharable.
